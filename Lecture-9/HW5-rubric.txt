================================================================================

Laboratory: Debugging a C Program (50 points)

- Correct Log Format (5 points)
  Please follow the spec defined in "Submic" section of the homework. You will
lost these points if your submission violates any requirement.

- Reproduce/ build process (10 points)
  Build the code from the tarball and reproduce the bug. You need record the
following in your lab log:
    * The command you use to build / explain the problem with original
      code(5 points)
    * Generally describe the results of the command (5 points)

- Expalin the reason why patch fix the bug (5 points)
  You need to answer this question by:
    * Pointing out the errornous code and what's wrong 
    * Explain how the patch fix it

- Debug to find the problem (15 points)
  You need to record the following in your lab log:
    * The debugging command you used (7.5 points)
    * The problem of the code. What's wrong? (7.5 points)

- lab5.diff (15 points)
  Your lab5.diff will be graded based on:
    * Correctness. The diff file should fix the bug. (10 points)
    * Format. You need use the correct file format specified in the assignment.
      (5 points)

================================================================================

Homework: Binary sort and remove duplicates (50 points)

This part of the homework will be graded based on your code (binsortu.c). You do
not need to submit your executable file.

You start from the 50 points, and will be penalized if you made any mistakes
listed below.

- Compilation
  If you source code CANNOT be compiled using gcc, you will get 0 points.

- Input
  read input from: stdin.
  Your program should be able to read the input from stdin until it meets the
end of file. Otherwise, you will be penalized by 10 point.
  You are required to read every N bytes as a block from the input,
failed to do so will result in a 5 points penalty. Moreover, this will
affect your output, so that you may lose more points.

- Output
  write output to: stdout
  If your program fails to write output to stdout, you will get 
  Your output should contain sorted byte blocks with length N without
duplication. 
  You will be penalized following the rules:
    a) Number of output records is incorrect (-15 points)
    b) (a) passed, but order of output records is incorrect (-10 points)
    c) (a) and (b) passed, but fail to pad the trailing '\0' (-5 points)

- Error Handling
  You need handle the following errors. Missing each of the following will
result in a 5 points penalty. 
    * I/O failure
    * allocation failure
    * wrong arguments (number of arguments, argument format)
  Error handling includes capturing the error, reporting the error to stderr
and returning proper exit code.
  
- Follow the format spec.
  If the format checking command (just above the "Submit" section in the
assignment description) retuns any output to your code, you will be penalized
for 5 points.

- Using the required library
  You should use the required library to write your code. Otherwise, you will be
penalized for 5 points. The required library is specified in the assignment
description.
